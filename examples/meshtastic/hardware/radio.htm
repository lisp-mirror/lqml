    <h3>Simple Meshtastic Radio</h3>
    <p>My take on a home made solution for an affordable, reliable radio:
      <br>(no superfluous parts - very low energy consumption)
    </p>
    <img src="radio.jpg" width=200>
    <ul>
      <li><b>WisBlock Meshtastic</b> <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit" target="_blank">Starter Kit</a>: no display (not needed), no GPS (taken from phone), very low energy consumption
      <li>cheap <b>enclosure</b> 100 x 60 x 25 mm for electronics (no screws)
      <li>3.7V <b>18650</b> rechargeable <b>battery</b> + battery holder
      <li><b>toggle switch</b> (no standby consumption)
      <li><b>antenna</b> (bendable 90°) 868 MHz (Europe) + <b>pigtail</b> (IPEX-SMA)
    </ul>
    <p>All parts above combined cost me around 50€.</p>
    <p>I used a soldering iron, a hot glue gun, a step drill bit, double sided tape.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Antennas</h3>
    <p>
    A good antenna is crucial for the radio to function properly. A <a href="https://nanovna.com/" target="_blank">NanoVNA</a> is very helpful to test if an antenna is resonant at the specified frequency (otherwise it's useless). You can find good clones for about 50€/$ (beware of really cheap/bad clones).
    </p>
    <p>
    Antennas listed in the <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/" target="_blank">RAK store</a> are generally of good/industrial quality. Some other mass produced offerings are of such bad quality that I had to throw them away (after measuring them).
