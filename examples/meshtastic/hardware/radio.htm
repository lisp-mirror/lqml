    <h2>Simple Meshtastic Radio</h2>
    <p>
      My take on a home made solution for an affordable, reliable radio:
      <br>(no superfluous parts - very low energy consumption)
    </p>

    <br><small><i>open radio / inside a camera bag</u></small>
    <ul>
      <li>WisBlock Meshtastic <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit" target="_blank">Starter Kit</a>: no display (not needed), no GPS (taken from phone), very low energy consumption
      <li>cheap enclosure 100 x 60 x 25 mm for electronics (no screws)
      <li>3.7V 18650 rechargeable battery + battery holder
      <li>toggle switch (no standby consumption)
      <li>antenna (bendable 90°) either 868 MHz (Europe) or 915 MHz (USA) + pigtail (IPEX-SMA)
    </ul>
    <p><small><i>Make sure both antenna and pigtail match, so they must be both <b>SMA</b>, or alternatively both <b>RP-SMA</b></i>.</small></p>
    <p>All parts above combined cost me around 50€.</p>
    <p>I used a soldering iron, a hot glue gun, a step drill bit, double sided tape.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Antennas</h2>
    <p>
    <i><small>Important: never power on your radio without a mounted antenna, this can destroy your hardware (power is reflected back to the radio).</small></i>
    </p>
    <p>
    A good antenna is crucial for the radio to function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
    A <a href="https://nanovna.com/" target="_blank">NanoVNA</a> is very helpful to test if an antenna is resonant at the specified frequency (otherwise it's useless).
    <br>The <i>Return Loss</i> should be &gt;= 10dB at the used frequency, which means that at least 90% of the power is going out of the antenna, and only 10% is reflected back to the radio.
    </p>
    <pre><small><b> RL    back  out  VSWR</b>
---------------------------
 0 dB  100%   0%  infinity
 1 dB   80%  20%  17
 2 dB   63%  37%   9
 3 dB   50%  50%   6
 5 dB   32%  68%   3.5
 6 dB   25%  75%   3
 8 dB   16%  84%   2.3
10 dB   10%  90%   2
15 dB    3%  97%   1.4
20 dB    1%  99%   1.2

<b>RL</b> ..... Return Loss
<b>back</b> ... reflected back to radio
<b>out</b> .... going out of antenna
<b>VSWR</b> ... Voltage Standing Wave Ratio</small></pre>
    <p>
    You can find good NanoVNA clones for about 50€/$ (beware of really cheap/bad clones).
    </p>

    <p>
    The screenshot shows a very good <i>Return Loss</i> of 22dB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The antenna needs to be in vertical position while testing, so it's best practice to build a little stand for it, so one can test without touching the circuit, which would inevitably falsify the measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's highly recommended to only trust specialized shops (Mouser, Rokland, RAK store) for antennas, because there is simply too much mass produced garbage out there (talking from experience).
    </p>
    <p>
    Here you can see the inside of one good example, and the worst offender so far:

    Here an example of a classical (home made) ground plane antenna, using an SMA socket and 2 mm copper wire, after calculating the lengths <a href="https://m0ukd.com/calculators/quarter-wave-ground-plane-antenna-calculator/" target="_blank">here</a>:
    <p>

    <p><small><i>Can easily be trimmed by making the vertical wire a little too long, and cutting off one mm after another until it matches perfectly, while having it attached to a NanoVNA.</i></small></p>

    <h2>Line of Sight</h2>
    To easily find out if two places are within line of sight, you can use this

    The RAK store has this nice <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/unify-enclosure-ip65-100x75x38-solar?variant=42490657439942" target="_blank">enclosure</a> where there is enough space for both a 18650 battery and a RAK <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-base-board-rak19003" target="_blank">19003 Mini Board</a>.
    </p>
    <p><small><i>The above combination is not supported by the mounting kit, so this is just a personal hack, as you can see if you zoom in on the details.</i></small></p>
