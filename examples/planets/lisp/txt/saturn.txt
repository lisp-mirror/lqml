Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturn is a gas giant with an atmosphere predominantly of hydrogen, with a small fraction of helium and trace amounts of several other compounds. The most prominent feature of Saturn is its ring system, which has been known to astronomy since less than half a century after the invention of the telescope and was for more than three centuries the only ring system known to man. 

Saturn has been known to post-diluvian man since the beginnings of recorded history. The Hindus called Saturn Sani, one of nine objects called the Navagraha that constituted a celestial council.
