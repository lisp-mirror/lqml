This is a debug dialog (taken from example cl-repl) to be integrated in your
app.

So, if you merge this example with your app, the mobile app will not crash on
an eventual runtime error: an interactive debug dialog will be shown instead.

This is especially helpful on android, where Lisp issues are hard to debug once
the app is installed.
