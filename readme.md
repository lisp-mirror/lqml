WIP
---

Currently Linux/macOS/desktop only, will be extended to mobile; not sure about
Windows though.


Description
-----------

A lightweight ECL based QML-only binding to Qt5/Qt6.


License
-------

ECL and Qt5/Qt6 are LGPL.
LQML can be considered public domain.


Tested
------

Only tested with **Qt5.15** and latest **Qt6**. It's recommended to use the new
Qt online installer (see [doc/get-qt6](doc/get-qt6.md)), where you can choose
to install different Qt versions side by side, sharing the same Qt Creator.


TODO
----

* make example work on android
* make example work on iOS
* add item model example
* add sokoban example
* port to CMake
